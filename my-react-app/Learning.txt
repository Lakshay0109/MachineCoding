Correct rule
✔ Default export → import without { } Just With Name
✔ Named export → import WITH { }


** Everytime create a project from scratch and start learning in VScode.

We write js in script tag in last inside the body tag as Dom manipulation can only be done once the dom is loaded.

function foo() {}
const foo = () => {}
Functional components in React mostly use arrow functions.
Keeps code clean and avoids hoisting confusion
